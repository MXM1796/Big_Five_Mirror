,text,start,duration
0,I don't know if they make uh textbook,0.42,5.879
1,covers that are this cool anymore I mean,3.06,5.459
2,look at that what a cool cover this is,6.299,4.321
3,called fundamentals of physics this is,8.519,4.261
4,the fifth edition it's volume one and,10.62,4.559
5,it's by holiday Resnick and Walker and,12.78,5.04
6,so this book is considered a classic I,15.179,7.68
7,have very very old versions of,17.82,7.32
8,um I think I have one or two different,22.859,5.041
9,volumes of the old version of this book,25.14,4.08
10,which is really quite interesting and,27.9,3.779
11,maybe one day I can compare like the old,29.22,4.56
12,version to the new version but in this,31.679,3.361
13,video I just want to show you this book,33.78,4.86
14,I bought this used it was not expensive,35.04,6.42
15,I will try to leave a link in the,38.64,5.04
16,description if I can find it in case you,41.46,4.38
17,want to read the reviews or pick up a,43.68,4.08
18,copy this is a great book for someone,45.84,4.559
19,who is trying to learn physics so I'm,47.76,5.04
20,not going to say that you can buy this,50.399,5.101
21,book and just like easily learn physics,52.8,5.04
22,I I think that's that's not true physics,55.5,4.14
23,is a hard subject it's just like math,57.84,3.899
24,and while this is predominantly a math,59.64,4.259
25,Channel I know a lot of you like physics,61.739,3.78
26,and there's just such an intricate,63.899,3.781
27,connection between mathematics and,65.519,4.021
28,physics physics that I thought I should,67.68,3.299
29,make this video on this book I've had it,69.54,3.06
30,for a while let me just show you what,70.979,3.301
31,it's about so,72.6,3.78
32,kind of cool look you open it up and,74.28,4.019
33,it's got mathematical formulas oh look,76.38,3.96
34,it's got the quadratic formula so that,78.299,3.36
35,already should bring you some comfort,80.34,3.48
36,because you probably know the quadratic,81.659,4.5
37,formula which is kind of nice you notice,83.82,3.659
38,there's actually already a little,86.159,3.481
39,mistake there if you want to be picky,87.479,4.68
40,they should be saying that a is not zero,89.64,5.159
41,so already we have found a mathematical,92.159,5.041
42,error in this physics book now I don't,94.799,4.261
43,want to call it an error just just a,97.2,3.599
44,slight oversight and it's really not a,99.06,4.26
45,big deal clearly a cannot be zero,100.799,4.741
46,otherwise this expression does not make,103.32,3.24
47,sense,105.54,3.36
48,then you have the binomial theorem,106.56,3.48
49,I think they're just trying to be,108.9,4.62
50,concise here some trig identities,110.04,5.82
51,products of vectors interesting let,113.52,4.32
52,Theta be the smaller of the two angles,115.86,4.02
53,between A and B then,117.84,4.5
54,a dot b is equal to B dot a which is,119.88,5.279
55,equal to a b cosine Theta right,122.34,5.4
56,then you've got a cross B that's the,125.159,5.221
57,cross product there,127.74,5.639
58,Cramer's rule wow it's interesting,130.38,4.999
59,choices of things that it's you know,133.379,4.621
60,revisiting here and then some trig,135.379,4.181
61,derivatives,138.0,4.08
62,sum not all just sine and cosine in the,139.56,3.78
63,integrals of sine and cosine and then,142.08,3.62
64,the exponentials and then some other,143.34,5.039
65,integrals which apparently are needed in,145.7,3.7
66,the book,148.379,2.281
67,talks a little bit about the Greek,149.4,3.66
68,alphabet yeah cool all right so let's,150.66,4.92
69,let's open up the book because let's,153.06,3.48
70,check it out right let's look at what,155.58,2.46
71,it's got this is the fifth edition,156.54,4.02
72,there's probably a newer Edition out,158.04,4.38
73,again I I didn't pay a lot for this book,160.56,4.86
74,I got it used so that means that there's,162.42,5.52
75,probably a newer Edition,165.42,4.44
76,textbook by the way so,167.94,3.36
77,um when you're comparing books and stuff,169.86,3.0
78,just keep that in mind right this book,171.3,3.659
79,has a lot of content,172.86,3.3
80,um tons,174.959,3.301
81,David Halliday University of Pittsburgh,176.16,6.299
82,Robert Resnick Rensselaer Polytechnic,178.26,7.199
83,Institute and Gerald Walker Cleveland,182.459,5.721
84,State University,185.459,2.721
85,oh here we go,189.54,3.24
86,hello there you are about to begin your,190.98,3.96
87,first college level Physics course you,192.78,3.66
88,may have heard from friends and fellow,194.94,2.76
89,students at physics is a difficult,196.44,3.36
90,course it is especially if you don't,197.7,3.78
91,plan to go on to a career in the hard,199.8,3.84
92,Sciences but that doesn't mean it has to,201.48,4.74
93,be difficult for you the key to success,203.64,3.959
94,in this course is to have a good,206.22,2.939
95,understanding of each chapter before,207.599,3.36
96,moving on to the next,209.159,3.241
97,one learned a little bit at a time,210.959,3.121
98,physics is straightforward and simple,212.4,3.66
99,here are some ideas that can make this,214.08,4.2
100,text and this class work for you so it,216.06,5.099
101,gives you some some tips for reading the,218.28,6.06
102,book and studying and using this uh for,221.159,6.3
103,for a course and you know they're right,224.34,4.619
104,a little bit at a time is a good way to,227.459,3.301
105,do it if you just do a little bit of,228.959,4.081
106,physics every day you're gonna get,230.76,4.68
107,better right it's it's it's just so much,233.04,3.9
108,better than cramming,235.44,3.48
109,right it's so much better I mean,236.94,3.24
110,sometimes you have to cram if you're,238.92,3.239
111,taking a class in college or something,240.18,4.02
112,but,242.159,4.381
113,look at the contents,244.2,4.259
114,check out those contents the pages are,246.54,3.54
115,there we go,248.459,3.901
116,this this this is since it's a newer,250.08,3.719
117,Edition the pages I feel like they have,252.36,3.0
118,some kind of coding and they're very,253.799,3.66
119,very thin but they feel very good like,255.36,4.2
120,they're very good quality,257.459,4.141
121,chapter one is on measurement so,259.56,3.96
122,measuring things the International,261.6,5.52
123,System of Units changing units length,263.52,5.58
124,time and Mass,267.12,4.32
125,chapter two is on motion along a,269.1,4.56
126,straight line really basic stuff what,271.44,3.78
127,gives the thrill in Drag Racing but it's,273.66,3.24
128,still interesting and it's still,275.22,4.74
129,something that if you don't know it it's,276.9,4.92
130,going to take some effort to learn,279.96,4.08
131,so position and displacement average,281.82,4.56
132,velocity and average speed instantaneous,284.04,3.719
133,velocity as we're talking about a,286.38,2.58
134,derivative there,287.759,4.801
135,and speed acceleration acceleration is,288.96,6.0
136,the derivative of velocity,292.56,4.98
137,constant acceleration another look at,294.96,4.26
138,constant acceleration and then Free Fall,297.54,3.36
139,acceleration and then the particles of,299.22,3.12
140,physics,300.9,3.54
141,chapter 3 is on vectors how can vectors,302.34,5.7
142,be used in cave exploring cool and it's,304.44,6.12
143,got basic stuff unit vectors A unit,308.04,5.46
144,Vector is a vector whose length is one,310.56,5.699
145,adding vectors by components vectors and,313.5,4.259
146,the laws of physics by the way unit,316.259,3.781
147,vectors are important because at least,317.759,3.421
148,in my opinion one reason they're,320.04,2.879
149,important is that they make the formulas,321.18,3.48
150,a little bit more simple,322.919,4.081
151,um at least in calculus because if if,324.66,4.2
152,the norm is one it kind of just goes,327.0,4.139
153,away from the formula the norm is the,328.86,4.86
154,length of the vector chapter four Motion,331.139,4.741
155,in two and three dimensions,333.72,4.74
156,wow pictures there,335.88,4.2
157,moving in two or three dimensions yeah,338.46,3.06
158,we live in a three-dimensional world so,340.08,3.3
159,it's kind of important,341.52,4.08
160,nice,343.38,4.5
161,very nice,345.6,6.319
162,chapter five force in motion,347.88,4.039
163,what causes an acceleration in Newton's,352.08,4.619
164,first law Force Mass,354.479,4.261
165,chapter six force and motion two is a,356.699,3.541
166,lot of information in this book right it,358.74,3.239
167,moves at a pretty quick Pace chapter,360.24,4.98
168,seven kinetic energy and work,361.979,5.701
169,eight potential energy and conservation,365.22,3.6
170,of energy,367.68,5.239
171,nine systems of particles,368.82,4.099
172,10 collisions,374.039,5.341
173,11 rotation I mean look at all of this,376.139,6.481
174,stuff so much physics in here,379.38,5.939
175,rolling torque and angular momentum 13,382.62,4.68
176,equilibrium and elasticity 14,385.319,4.981
177,gravitation,387.3,3.0
178,you wouldn't think that this book would,390.72,3.9
179,have this much content but it does right,392.4,4.94
180,oh wow fluids,394.62,5.22
181,oscillations simple harmonic motion,397.34,6.22
182,that's something that you see uh in trig,399.84,5.4
183,you do a little bit of simple harmonic,403.56,4.38
184,motion also uh in in differential,405.24,6.42
185,equations you do some some stuff with,407.94,6.96
186,um Springs and stuff waves,411.66,6.96
187,it's chapter 17 18 is waves part two how,414.9,5.46
188,does a bat detect a moth in total,418.62,4.44
189,darkness I don't know I should know but,420.36,6.6
190,I don't sound waves speed of sound,423.06,6.84
191,cool Doppler effect,426.96,4.92
192,chapter 19 temperature Heat and the,429.9,4.2
193,first law of thermodynamics,431.88,6.0
194,20 kinetic theory of gases,434.1,5.939
195,21 entropy and the second law of,437.88,3.96
196,Thermodynamics yeah really important,440.039,3.901
197,stuff I always I always think about the,441.84,3.6
198,Nobel Prize right there is there is a,443.94,3.42
199,Nobel Prize you can get The Nobel Prize,445.44,4.199
200,for physics you can't get the Nobel,447.36,4.92
201,Prize for math so it's kind of weird it,449.639,4.5
202,just feels wrong uh but you can get it,452.28,3.24
203,for physics and then here answers to,454.139,2.641
204,checkpoints and odd numbered questions,455.52,3.179
205,and exercises and problems let's start,456.78,3.78
206,by looking at the answers,458.699,4.681
207,to see what kind of support you're going,460.56,5.759
208,to get as you know an individual learner,463.38,4.439
209,like if you're self-studying and look at,466.319,3.0
210,this look at all of these answers it's,467.819,4.561
211,perfect it's like you get answers to all,469.319,4.741
212,the odd odd numbered problems I mean,472.38,2.7
213,look at that,474.06,3.539
214,so many answers,475.08,5.28
215,so many answers so great for self-study,477.599,4.44
216,um especially if you if you're looking,480.36,4.739
217,for like a good physics book this is,482.039,5.28
218,this is a classic right this is perhaps,485.099,4.201
219,I don't know but this might be probably,487.319,3.66
220,like the one of the most popular physics,489.3,3.48
221,books ever written the one by holiday at,490.979,4.62
222,Resnick and and Walker so and there's,492.78,5.039
223,different versions this one's volume one,495.599,3.78
224,right there's there's different,497.819,3.78
225,there's different versions of this book,499.379,5.04
226,they've reprinted it so many times it's,501.599,4.5
227,just one of those like long-term books,504.419,4.081
228,that's been out forever,506.099,3.961
229,here are some of the exercises this,508.5,3.06
230,should bring you back memories if you,510.06,3.599
231,ever took a physics class sitting down,511.56,4.2
232,and reading through word problems and,513.659,4.5
233,trying to figure them out it's,515.76,3.6
234,especially uncomfortable when you're,518.159,2.82
235,doing that in a test situation and you,519.36,3.96
236,have no idea what's going on,520.979,5.101
237,um I personally took three classes in,523.32,5.459
238,physics I took University Physics one,526.08,5.699
239,University Physics two and then I took a,528.779,5.881
240,course called physics University Physics,531.779,5.221
241,3 which was a course on Modern physics,534.66,4.38
242,where we talked about other topics like,537.0,4.62
243,time dilation and relativity and stuff,539.04,5.76
244,like that so very fun courses I,541.62,5.339
245,struggled a lot in the first two I,544.8,3.84
246,didn't get A's I think I got B's or B,546.959,3.961
247,pluses and in the third one which is,548.64,4.5
248,supposed to be the hardest one I had a,550.92,5.039
249,different teacher and I got an A so,553.14,4.139
250,yeah it's cool I like how they have,555.959,3.0
251,pictures and stuff,557.279,3.901
252,a collision is an isolated event in,558.959,4.621
253,which two or more bodies the colliding,561.18,4.62
254,bodies exert relatively strong forces on,563.58,5.819
255,each other for a relatively short time,565.8,5.219
256,yeah so physics books are a little bit,569.399,3.541
257,different than math books well first of,571.019,3.841
258,all it's not it's not math it's physics,572.94,4.56
259,but you see there's a lot of reading in,574.86,6.72
260,math I feel like the books,577.5,6.3
261,you you need to I'm not saying you don't,581.58,4.02
262,need a pencil to read this you do you,583.8,3.599
263,want to read this carefully and work,585.6,3.9
264,through it but it's different right,587.399,4.021
265,there's a it's just a different,589.5,3.839
266,it's a different field you see in a math,591.42,3.3
267,book you might have like two paragraphs,593.339,2.821
268,and then already you're at proposition,594.72,3.54
269,example you're jumping into the math,596.16,3.84
270,here there's a lot of explanation you,598.26,3.98
271,see,600.0,2.24
272,there's a lot of explanation then you,602.519,3.781
273,get some formulas so it just takes a lot,603.959,3.781
274,a lot of reading,606.3,3.36
275,and a lot of patience,607.74,4.5
276,so yeah,609.66,5.1
277,it's a great book on physics oh look,612.24,4.02
278,there's a formula that everyone knows,614.76,4.92
279,perhaps E equals m c squared it's a,616.26,4.82
280,popular one,619.68,4.86
281,look at that in 1979 students of,621.08,5.439
282,Shenandoah Junior High School in Miami,624.54,4.739
283,Florida honored Albert Einstein on the,626.519,4.021
284,100th anniversary of his birth by,629.279,3.361
285,spelling out his famous formula with,630.54,5.34
286,their bodies oh that's really cool wow,632.64,5.28
287,so,635.88,5.28
288,yeah anyways it's a physics book it's,637.92,5.16
289,got an awesome cover I just love the,641.16,3.359
290,cover and,643.08,3.54
291,um it's a famous one so pretty decent,644.519,4.56
292,for self-study uh you know it's not,646.62,4.38
293,going to be easy none of it's easy right,649.079,4.2
294,but hey you just do a little bit every,651.0,4.68
295,day and the next thing you know you are,653.279,4.56
296,a physics master I hope this video has,655.68,4.32
297,been helpful until next time good luck,657.839,4.821
298,and take care,660.0,2.66
